# About

I started this site as a playground for various visualization techniques, where I can test what is working well, and what is not working at all. I am PRA analyst working in nuclear industry, so data comes mostly from PRA results.

I hope, that the examples shown here will be useful for you too. 

If you have questions, you can contact Gennady Loskutov at visualpra(at)gmail.com.
