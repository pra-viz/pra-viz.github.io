# Things I want to do

These are plans for future "let's see what happens if I ...". 

## Confidence in calculated results

The idea is to make a scatter chart for the results aggregated on IE level, where IE frequency is plot along X-axis and the barrier against CD/LERF - along the Y-axis, using lognumber of calculated MCS as the point size. Result trustworthiness is shown as point size and is readily visible for analysis.

## All MCS on one chart

It would be interesting to see waht happens if all MCS from PRA are put into one scatter chart ((frequency, barrier) with color by IE class and shape by op_mode). This can be used to produce probability density distribution in 2D by IE class and probability density distribution by op_mode.

## Changes in PRA results over time 

PRA results for total CDF/LERF over decades as a radar chart

## Changes in impact to CDF/LERF from different IE types over time

Impact from IE types (internal, external, hazards) on total CDF/LERF over time as stacked area chart to show major phases of PRA development. The same can be done also to show impact from op_mode on total CDF/LERF over time as stacked area chart.

## Cluster response to different IE by event combinations in the results

Cluster response to different IE using qualitative results (i.e. event combinations) to show, which IE produce similar failed response. This can answer questions about which components are important for which events.
